# Architex Launchpad — binding spec (v1.1)

Bonding-curve token launches that graduate into Architex pools. Adapted from the owner's draft
(`docs/launchpad/MemeDEX-design.md`): same economics (1B fixed supply, 800M on the curve, graduation at
a $100,000 market cap measured on the 800M (v1.2; v1.1 graduated at $35,000), 0.5% platform fee, flat launch fee), but the AMM is the
existing Architex factory/pair instead of a second pool implementation. LP staking / epoch fee
distribution and dynamic AMM fees are **out of scope for v1**.

The ABI in `contracts/interfaces/IArchitexLaunchpad.sol` and `ILaunchToken.sol` is frozen: the frontend
is built against it. Solidity 0.8.28, OpenZeppelin 5.1.0, EVM `paris`, `via_ir`, same as the AMM.

## Contracts

- `ArchitexLaunchpad` — the only entry point: creates tokens, runs every curve, graduates them.
  Constructor `(address usdc, address factory, address feeTo, address feeToSetter, uint256 launchFee)`.
- `LaunchToken` — OZ ERC20, 18 decimals, 1,000,000,000e18 minted once to the launchpad in the
  constructor, no mint/burn function afterwards, no owner.

## Constants (immutable)

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `TOTAL_SUPPLY` | 1_000_000_000e18 |
| `CURVE_SUPPLY` | 800_000_000e18 (sold on the curve) |
| `POOL_SUPPLY` | 200_000_000e18 (seeds the Architex pair at graduation) |
| `VIRTUAL_TOKENS_0` | 1_066_666_667e18 |
| `VIRTUAL_USDC_0` | 8_333_333_333 (8,333.333333 USDC, 6 decimals). Sets the scale: a curve raises 3× this. v1.1 used 2_916_666_667 (an 8,750 USDC raise), which the owner judged too thin a pool |
| `FEE_BPS` | 50 (0.5%), `MAX_LAUNCH_FEE` = 100e6 |
| `DEAD` | 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD |

## Curve math (constant product on virtual reserves)

Per token the launchpad stores `virtualUsdc` (starts `VIRTUAL_USDC_0`), `virtualTokens` (starts
`VIRTUAL_TOKENS_0`), `tokensSold`. `k = virtualUsdc * virtualTokens` is recomputed from the stored
reserves on every trade (never stored). Real USDC held for a curve is always
`virtualUsdc - VIRTUAL_USDC_0`, so every sold token can always be sold back (solvency invariant).
Spot price = `virtualUsdc / virtualTokens`.

- **Buy** `usdcIn` (gross): `fee = ceil(usdcIn * FEE_BPS / 10_000)` (fees round UP: a floor makes
  every trade under 200 units free); `net = usdcIn - fee`;
  `tokensOut = virtualTokens - ceil(k / (virtualUsdc + net))`. If `tokensOut >= remaining`
  (`remaining = CURVE_SUPPLY - tokensSold`), fill exactly the remainder:
  `net = ceil(k / (virtualTokens - remaining)) - virtualUsdc`,
  `usdcSpent = min(usdcIn, net + ceil(net * FEE_BPS / (10_000 - FEE_BPS)))`, `fee = usdcSpent - net`.
  **`usdcSpent` is never greater than `usdcIn`**; pull exactly `usdcSpent` (never pull-then-refund).
  `tokensOut == 0` reverts `ZeroAmount`. Rounding always favours the curve.
- **Sell** `tokensIn`: `gross = virtualUsdc - ceil(k / (virtualTokens + tokensIn))`;
  `fee = ceil(gross * FEE_BPS / 10_000)`; seller receives `gross - fee`; zero proceeds revert `ZeroAmount`;
  `tokensIn > tokensSold` reverts `ExceedsSold`. `quoteSell` reverts exactly where `sell` would.
- `tokensSold` is **net**: `+=` on buys, `-=` on sells. Circulating supply before graduation equals
  `tokensSold`, so nobody can sell more than it; `virtualUsdc` never drops below `VIRTUAL_USDC_0`.
- `quoteBuy` / `quoteSell` must share the trade functions' code path (one internal pure function each),
  including the cap and the `graduates` flag.
- **Fees are accrued, never pushed.** Trade fees and the launch fee add to `pendingFees` inside the
  launchpad; the permissionless `collectFees()` sends `pendingFees` to `feeTo`. A blocklisted or
  reverting `feeTo` (Arc USDC enforces a blocklist) must never be able to stop a trade, a launch or a
  graduation.
- Arc trap: native USDC (18 decimals) and the ERC-20 interface (6 decimals) are the same balance.
  Never read `balanceOf` or `address(this).balance` for accounting; every amount comes from the
  curve's own stored numbers. No `receive`/`fallback`.
- Reference vectors (must match to the unit; they come from `src/lib/curve.ts`): see "Test vectors".
- With these constants a curve opens at a $6,250 market cap and selling it out ends at price 0.000125 USDC
  (= $100,000 on 800M, a 16× rise), having raised ≈ 25,000 USDC, and `25,000 / 200M` is the same price:
  the pool opens where the curve ends, holding 25,000 USDC × 200M tokens.

## Lifecycle

1. `createToken(name, symbol, metadataURI, initialBuyUsdc, minTokensOut)`: pulls `launchFee` from the
   creator into `pendingFees`, deploys `LaunchToken`, takes `pair = factory.getPair(token, usdc)` or creates it if absent
   (**never revert because the pair already exists**: anyone can pre-create it), calls
   `token.initPair(pair)`, records the curve, emits `TokenCreated`, then performs the creator's
   optional first buy in the same transaction (anti-snipe). Name 1–32 bytes, symbol 1–10 bytes,
   metadataURI ≤ 256 bytes.
2. `buy` / `sell` with slippage bounds and a `to` recipient, until the curve sells out. `sell` needs no
   ERC-20 approval: the launchpad calls `token.launchpadPull(msg.sender, amount)` and **only ever
   with `msg.sender`**.
3. **Graduation** happens inside the buy that sells the last curve token, atomically and in this
   order with no other external call in between: (a) the buyer's USDC is already pulled and the fee
   accrued; (b) `require(pair.totalSupply() == 0)`; (c) mark the curve graduated and call
   `token.markGraduated()`; (d) transfer exactly `POOL_SUPPLY` tokens and exactly
   `usdcSeeded = virtualUsdc - VIRTUAL_USDC_0` **of that curve** to the pair (never a balance);
   (e) `liquidityLocked = pair.mint(DEAD)` (the return value, liquidity locked forever);
   (f) emit `Graduated`.
   It must **not** use the router: a donated-and-`sync()`ed pair (reserves `(0, x)`) would make the
   router's quote revert and brick graduation. Direct `mint` accepts the launchpad's deposits in
   either case. Final pair reserves include the donation; `Graduated.usdcSeeded` records only the
   curve's exact contribution. A synced donation is already in reserves and excluded from the
   first mint's deposit delta, while an unsynced donation is included in that delta.
4. After graduation `buy`/`sell` revert with `CurveGraduated()`; trading continues on the Architex pair.

## Token transfer rule

While not graduated, `LaunchToken` reverts any transfer whose recipient is `pair`. Nobody can deposit
launch tokens to the pair early, so `totalSupply` of the pair is 0 at graduation. USDC can still be
donated to the pair; the opening price matches the curve only when there is no prior USDC donation.
All other transfers are free from the first buy.

## Admin surface (the owner's Ledger)

`feeToSetter` controls the fee recipient, launch fee, relayer allowlist and bounded relay fees through
`setFeeTo` (not zero, not the launchpad itself), `setLaunchFee(≤ MAX_LAUNCH_FEE)`, `setRelayer` and
`setRelayFees`. `setFeeToSetter` transfers those controls to a nonzero successor; the zero address
reverts with `ZeroAddress()` and leaves the admin and configuration unchanged. This preserves the
ability to rotate relayers trusted for external settlement credit and refunds on the launchpad and
the board, whose relayer allowlist follows the launchpad. Recovery remains an explicitly trusted
relayer operation, subject to the payment rules in `docs/agents/X402-GATE-SPEC.md`.
There is no pause, upgrade, access to accounted curve funds or parameter change to live curves.
`name`, `symbol` and `metadataURI` are untrusted bytes with length limits only; uniqueness is not
enforced and rendering rules live in `FRONTEND-BRIEF.md`.

## Security requirements (each needs a test)

- Reentrancy guard on `createToken`/`buy`/`sell`; checks-effects-interactions; SafeERC20.
- Solvency invariant (fuzz + invariant test): USDC held ≥ `pendingFees` + Σ(`virtualUsdc - VIRTUAL_USDC_0`)
  over non-graduated curves; `k` never decreases across a trade; `tokensSold ≤ CURVE_SUPPLY`;
  `virtualTokens + tokensSold == VIRTUAL_TOKENS_0`. `SafeCast` on every `uint128` write.
- Round trip: buy then immediately sell the same tokens never returns more USDC than was paid.
- Graduation is atomic; works when the pair pre-exists and with prior USDC donations to the pair
  (with or without `sync()`). The launchpad transfers and emits the exact curve seed; final pair
  reserves also include donations, and all initial LP tokens end at `DEAD`. The pool opens at the
  curve's final price within 1e-6 relative **when the pair held no USDC beforehand**.
- A zero admin transfer reverts without changing state or emitting an admin update; a nonzero
  successor can still rotate the fee recipient, bounded fees and relayers.
- Two live curves: graduating A leaves B's USDC untouched and B can still sell and graduate.
- A `feeTo` that reverts or is blocklisted never blocks `createToken`, `buy`, `sell` or graduation.
- Transfers to the pair revert before graduation and succeed after.
- `launchpadPull` is callable only by the launchpad; `initPair`/`markGraduated` only once, only by it.
- Exact-fill on the last buy never over-charges and never leaves dust tokens unsold.
- Fee-on-transfer / rebasing are irrelevant: the only quote asset is USDC, the only tokens are ours.

## Views for the frontend

`curves(token)` (reverts `UnknownToken` for an unknown token), `tokensLength()`, `tokenAt(i)`,
`curvesPage(start, count)` (`count` clamped to 100), `quoteBuy`, `quoteSell`, `pendingFees()`, and:

```text
spotPrice   = virtualUsdc * 1e36 / virtualTokens          // USDC units (6 dec) per WHOLE token, 1e18-scaled
marketCap   = virtualUsdc * CURVE_SUPPLY / virtualTokens  // USDC 6 dec; about 100_000e6 at graduation
progressBps = tokensSold * 10_000 / CURVE_SUPPLY          // multiply first
```

`Trade.trader` is always `msg.sender`. `Trade.usdcAmount` is the gross a buyer paid (fee included) or
the gross leaving the curve on a sell (the seller receives `usdcAmount - fee`); the virtual reserves in
the event are post-trade.

## Test vectors (from `src/lib/curve.ts`, must match to the unit)

## Deployment

Testnet first: `usdc = 0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000`,
`factory = 0x6362f5A0fc007AB7D1e61f99D3F4eB04360D060a` (Architex factory on Arc testnet 5042002).
Mainnet only after the adversarial review (Grok) and the fixes (Arc Studio) are both done.
